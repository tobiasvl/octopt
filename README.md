octopt
======

`octopt` is a library for handling CHIP-8 configuration settings.

CHIP-8 is a virtual machine for playing simple computer games. It has been around since 1977, and has many slightly incompatible implementations.

Games often require specific behavior from its interpreter to run correctly, but you can't know what behavior it expects just by looking at its bytecode.

This library contains structs and enums that represent all possible CHIP-8 options, which you can use for your CHIP-8 emulator.
